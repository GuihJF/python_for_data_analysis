# 📊 Brazilian Public Travel Analysis

This project is my first complete data analysis using Python. I worked with real travel data from Brazil to learn how to clean, explore, and understand information. I also created charts and exported results to Excel. Everything was done using Google Colab and simple Python tools.

## 🚀 What I Learned

- How to clean messy data and make it easier to work with
- How to find which job roles travel the most
- How to calculate travel costs and compare them
- How to create charts to show patterns
- How to save results in Excel for sharing

## 🛠️ Tools I Used

- **Python** – the main programming language
- **pandas** – to work with tables and data
- **matplotlib** – to make charts
- **Google Colab** – to write and run the code online
- **Git** – to save versions and fix mistakes

## 📁 Project Files:
This project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. You can view, download, or run the notebook using the link below:

- 📄 [Brazilian_public_travel_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/GuihJF/python_for_data_analysis/blob/main/Brazilian_public_travel_analysis.ipynb)

To run it locally, make sure you have Jupyter installed, or open it directly in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) for a quick start.

## 📈 What I Analyzed

- **Most frequent travelers**: Found job roles that travel the most
- **Travel costs**: Compared how much each role spends
- **Trip length vs. cost**: Checked if longer trips cost more
- **Smart filters**: Focused only on roles with meaningful travel data

## 📤 What I Exported

- A clean Excel file with the final summary
- A chart saved as an image
- Messages printed to confirm each step worked

## 🧠 Skills I Practiced

- Using pandas to filter and group data
- Making charts with matplotlib
- Writing clear and organized code
- Fixing Git history using rebase (even with conflicts!)

## 📌 How to Run This Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GuihJF/python_for_data_analysis.git

2. Install the tools:
bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
Open the notebook:

3. Open the notebook:
bash
jupyter notebook Data_Test_Python_for_Data.ipynb

- You can also run it in Google Colab by uploading the notebook file.
